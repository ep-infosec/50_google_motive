Motive Version 1.2.0   {#motive_readme}
====================

# Overview

Motive is an open-source, cross-platform, memory efficient, and performant
animation system.

# Features

The v1.1 release of Motive focusses on speed and scalability. Motive now
supports rigged character animation and blending between those animations.
Motive maintains its aptitude for procedural animation that was the focus of
v1.0.

# Downloading

Motive can be downloaded from [GitHub](http://github.com/google/motive) or
the [releases page](http://github.com/google/motive/releases).

**Important**: Motive uses submodules to reference other components it depends
upon so download the source using:

~~~{.sh}
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/google/motive.git
~~~

# Dependencies

Motive depends upon:

* [MathFu][] -- used internally; you can substitute your own vector types
  in the external API.
* [FplUtil][] -- C++ allocator libraries.

Motive has optional features that depend upon:

* [FlatBuffers][] -- allow animation data to be defined in json and then
  compiled to a small binary format.

# Notes

For applications on Google Play that integrate this tool, usage is tracked.
This tracking is done automatically using the embedded version string in
`kVersion`. Aside from consuming a few extra bytes in your application binary,
it shouldn't affect your application at all.  We use this information to let us
know if Motive is useful and if we should continue to invest in it. Since this
is open source, you are free to remove the version string, but we would
appreciate if you would leave it in.
